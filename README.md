# TIC-TAC-TOE Documentation

### Thank You!

Within this repository, you will find my unit 1 project submission&mdash;
a simple, two-player tic-tac-toe game. This is an ongoing project, through which
I intend to practice subsequent learnings and experiment with new technologies.

### Technologies Used

- html
- css
- sass
- bootstrap
- javascript
- jquery
- ajax
- JSON
- General Assembly Tic-Tac-Toe game API

### Process

From the start, I approached the project with a diminished focus on styles.
Priority was given to functionality. The product of my approach is a somewhat
spartan experience.

I considered the game engine to be the foundational element to the entire
application. Without a stable game engine, anything involving the UI and/or
API would be negatively impacted and the effects would ripple to other
application functions.

Consequently, I refactored the game engine later in the development process
when I realized that my efforts were being directed at work-arounds
relating to the game engine, rather than forward progress on the
project. This turned out to be a beneficial exercise as it enabled me to better
understand the cohesion of the different application components.

Additionally, the issue queue turned out to be an invaluable asset during
problem-solving. Time management is an important factor to success. Not
allowing oneself to ruminate endlessly results in better productivity. It was
also encouraging at times to encounter problems similar to mine that were solved
in the queue history.

Lastly, I finally allowed myself to take a step back and break down problems
into smaller chunks, which were rendered in pseudo-code and treated as
scaffolding for the task.

### Known Issues

**Accessibility**
  - The current project state will present accessibility concerns.

**Styles**
  - Much of the layout is supported by Bootstrap classes. This will be phased out
    in time.
  - Not entirely responsive.
  - Form fields do not stack as block elements.

**UI**
  - In some cases, player turn prompts do not display after a different activity
    populates the dialogue space.
